# Hey there, I'm Nathan

Hello, my name is Nathan and I've been coding since I was just 10 years old. I started with some simple HTML projects and quickly moved on to more complex development with PHP. But it was when I discovered Java that I truly found my passion. I loved creating Minecraft plugins for servers with friends.

At 14, I joined [Groupe MINASTE](https://github.com/GroupeMINASTE), a team of developers that specialize in creating top-quality websites and mobile apps for Android and iOS. With years of experience and a dedication to my craft, I am now committed to delivering exceptional results for every project I work on.

As a freelancer, I now specialize in developing mobile apps using Swift and Kotlin. These programming languages are my favorites because they allow me to create high-performance, user-friendly apps that are optimized for both iOS and Android platforms. I am passionate about creating apps that are not only functional but also visually appealing and easy to use. My expertise in Swift and Kotlin allows me to deliver high-quality apps that are tailored to meet my clients' specific needs and requirements.

To see my work in action, please visit [my website](https://www.nathanfallet.me) where you can find a portfolio of my past projects, including mobile apps, websites, and more. You can also find my contact information, so please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you're interested in working together on a project.
